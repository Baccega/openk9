With the **Standalone Search App** it's possible to perform multi-source, semantic, token-based searches, with a fast and efficient User Experience. The Standalone Search App is built with React and uses the same components provided with the NPM UI components package.

The Standalone Search App has its own Docker container ready to be deployed with a Web Server to serve the app static files.

You can look at the frontend code in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smclab/openk9/tree/main/js-packages/search-standalone-frontend).
